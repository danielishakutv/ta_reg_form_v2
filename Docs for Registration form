We have 2 Google forms, 
1. TA Registration
2. TA Enrollment

The form on the website has two sections but uses React UI to interact with user but submits to both Google Forms accordingly. 

TA Registration Form 
Capture basic info and contact information for further follow ups


TA Enrollment Form 
Course selection details and preferred start date and study mode of participant.

Auto fills if link is clicked from user's email. 


Opening with registration query params pre-fills the registration form fields.
UTMs parsed from URL (or default to "direct") are submitted as hidden entry.* fields on registration and enrollment.
Prefills persist in localStorage so a user can return and continue the form.
